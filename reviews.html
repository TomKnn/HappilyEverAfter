  <div class="review">I found the perfect match through HEA- it really works! Now I live in a castle watching the sunset every day with my strong jawlined hunk- my dream came true!</div>

  <div class="review">Thanks for sending that sociopath my way. Savings: gone, house: gone, children: gone.
    Driven and adaptable indeed. Maybe Ted Bundy next time?</div>
    <div class="name">- Sarah</div>

  <div class="review">How on earth did HEA manage to pair me with a dude?? I clearly stated 'heterosexual'!!
    Also, this guy is really frisky and won`t stay on his side of the bed. I want my goddamn money back!</div>

  <div class=reply>HEA: Sometimes the software makes unexpected decisions. You just have to trust it and go with the flow. We at HEA strongly believe you`ll be happy in a few years.</div>

  <div class="review">Just great, I didn`t respond to any of the matches because they completely sucked and now I`m in San Quentin getting to know a whole new definition of love with my 6,4 cellmate. I guess HappilyEverAfter wasn`t kidding with the legal warnings.. thanks alot *ssholes!</div>
