  <article>I found the perfect match through HEA- it really works! Now I live in a castle watching the sunset every day with my strong jawlined hunk- my dream came true!</article>

  <article>Thanks for sending that sociopath my way. Savings: gone, house: gone, children: gone.
    Driven and adaptable indeed. Maybe Ted Bundy next time?

  <article>How on earth did HEA manage to pair me with a dude?? I clearly stated 'heterosexual'!!
    Also, this guy is really frisky and won`t stay on his side of the bed. I want my goddamn money back!

  <p>HEA: Sometimes the software makes unexpected decisions. You just have to trust it and go with the flow. We at HEA strongly believe you`ll be happy in a few years.</p>

  <article>Just great, I didn`t respond to any of the matches because they completely sucked and now I`m in San Quentin getting to know a whole new definition of love with my 6,4 cellmate. I guess HappilyEverAfter wasn`t kidding with the legal warnings.. thanks alot *ssholes!

  <p>HEA: indeed we weren`t, but we`re happy things worked out anyhow. Please write a review of any current developments in your new relationship and godbless.</p>
